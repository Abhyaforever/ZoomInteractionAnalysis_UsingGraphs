# ZoomInteractionAnalysis

## Overview
Welcome to **ZoomInteractionAnalysis**! This project aims to analyze survey data to uncover meaningful insights from Zoom session interactions. By leveraging data crunching, graph theory, and visualization techniques, we strive to map and understand the network of interactions among participants.



## Project Description
This repository contains scripts and tools for analyzing a survey dataset where each respondent provides their name and the names of people they interacted with during Zoom sessions. The data is structured with one respondent per row and 20 columns representing the names of interacted individuals.

We aim to:
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Create visual representations of the interaction network.
- Apply graph theory to analyze the network structure.
- Generate insightful reports and visualizations.

## Data Source
- **Survey Data**: The dataset consists of respondents' names and the names of individuals they interacted with in Zoom sessions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhyaforever/ZoomInteractionAnalysis_UsingGraphs.git
